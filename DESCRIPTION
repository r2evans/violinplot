Authors@R: "Bill Evans <Bill@8PawExpress.com> [aut,cre]"
Description: Violin plot is a method for plotting numeric data using a
    rotated/mirrored kernel density plot. Other implementations exist
    (namely from ggplot2) that provide extensive customization. This
    package provides an implementation that relies solely on base
    graphics, yet still provides methods for data.frames, lists,
    vectors, and formulas.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0.0)
